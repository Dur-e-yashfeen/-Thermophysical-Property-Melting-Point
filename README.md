## 📌 Business Overview
In the pharmaceutical and materials science industries, the **melting point** is a critical physical property that determines a compound's stability, solubility, and processing requirements. Traditionally, this is measured via slow, manual lab experiments.

This project provides a **Machine Learning solution** to predict melting points directly from molecular descriptors. By digitizing this process, R&D teams can:
* **Reduce Lab Costs:** Minimize the need for physical testing of unviable compounds.
* **Speed up Synthesis:** Filter thousands of "virtual" molecules in seconds.
* **Optimize Formulations:** Predict stability early in the drug development pipeline.

## 🛠️ The Solution
This repository contains a predictive engine that processes chemical data and outputs temperature predictions with high precision.
